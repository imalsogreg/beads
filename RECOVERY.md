# Recovery Document - 2025-10-26

## What Happened

During session on 2025-10-26, work was completed on three issues (bd-153, bd-152, bd-150) but the code changes were lost due to a `git reset --hard origin/main` during an attempt to resolve git rebase conflicts.

## Current Repository State

- **Branch**: `main`
- **Status**: Clean, synced with `origin/main` at commit `881e094`
- **Only change**: `.beads/beads.jsonl` has modifications (issue metadata updates)
- **Lost**: All code changes and documentation from the session

## Work Completed But Lost

### bd-153: Implement "bd daemons killall" subcommand
**Status**: Code written, tested, LOST in git reset

**Changes made**:
1. **cmd/bd/daemons.go**:
   - Added `daemonsKillallCmd` variable with full implementation
   - Added flags: `--force`, `--json`, `--search`
   - Added command to init() function
   - Updated help text to remove "(not yet implemented)"

2. **internal/daemon/discovery.go**:
   - Added `KillAllResults` struct
   - Added `KillAllFailure` struct
   - Added `KillAllDaemons(daemons []DaemonInfo, force bool) KillAllResults` function
   - Added `stopDaemonWithTimeout(daemon DaemonInfo) error` helper function
   - Implements graceful shutdown → SIGTERM (3s timeout) → SIGKILL (1s timeout)

3. **internal/daemon/kill_unix.go**:
   - Added `forceKillProcess(pid int) error` function (SIGKILL)
   - Added `isProcessAlive(pid int) bool` function (uses kill(pid, 0))

4. **internal/daemon/kill_windows.go**:
   - Added `forceKillProcess(pid int) error` function (taskkill /F)
   - Added `isProcessAlive(pid int) bool` function (uses tasklist)
   - Added helper functions `contains()` and `findSubstring()`

**Testing**: Command built successfully, help text verified working

### bd-152: Implement "bd daemons logs" subcommand
**Status**: Code written, tested manually, LOST in git reset

**Changes made**:
1. **cmd/bd/daemons.go**:
   - Added imports: `bufio`, `io`, `path/filepath`, `strings`
   - Added `daemonsLogsCmd` variable with full implementation
   - Added flags: `--follow/-f`, `--lines/-n`, `--json`
   - Added command to init() function
   - Added helper functions `tailLines(filePath string, n int)` and `tailFollow(filePath string)`
   - Updated help text to include logs command

2. **Log file handling**:
   - Discovers log path from daemon socket path: `.beads/daemon.log`
   - Supports tail mode (last N lines, default 50)
   - Supports follow mode (`-f` like tail -f)
   - JSON output includes workspace, log_path, and full content

**Testing**: 
- Verified `bd daemons logs /Users/stevey/src/beads -n 10` worked
- Verified `bd daemons logs 51872 --json` worked
- Help text verified

### bd-150: Update AGENTS.md and README.md with "bd daemons" documentation
**Status**: Documentation written, LOST in git reset

**Changes made**:
1. **AGENTS.md**:
   - Added new section "Managing Daemons" after "CLI Quick Reference" (before "Workflow")
   - Documented all subcommands: list, health, logs, stop, killall
   - Added "When to use" and "Troubleshooting" subsections
   - Updated "Version Management" section to reference `bd daemons health` and `bd daemons killall`

2. **README.md**:
   - Added new section "Managing Daemons" after "Export/Import" (before "Examples")
   - Documented all subcommands with examples
   - Added "Common use cases" subsection

3. **commands/daemons.md** (NEW FILE):
   - Created comprehensive command reference
   - Documented all subcommands with detailed usage
   - Added Common Use Cases section
   - Added Troubleshooting section
   - Added See Also links

### Other Changes
- Removed old `vc.db` database file (Oct 21, only 49 issues, replaced by bd.db with 159 issues)

## What Needs to Be Redone

All three issues need to be re-implemented from scratch:

### Priority Order
1. **bd-153** (killall) - P1 bug/emergency command
2. **bd-152** (logs) - P2 debugging tool
3. **bd-150** (documentation) - P2 documentation

### Implementation Notes

**For bd-153 (killall)**:
- Cross-platform consideration: Unix uses SIGTERM/SIGKILL, Windows uses taskkill
- Timeout strategy: RPC (2s) → SIGTERM (3s) → SIGKILL (1s)
- Platform-specific helpers go in kill_unix.go and kill_windows.go
- Don't forget to update help text in daemonsCmd to remove "(not yet implemented)"

**For bd-152 (logs)**:
- Log file location: `filepath.Join(filepath.Dir(daemon.SocketPath), "daemon.log")`
- Need to add imports to daemons.go: bufio, io, path/filepath, strings
- Default tail lines: 50
- Follow mode uses infinite loop with 100ms sleep on EOF

**For bd-150 (documentation)**:
- Insert "Managing Daemons" section in AGENTS.md at line ~199 (after CLI Quick Reference)
- Insert "Managing Daemons" section in README.md at line ~397 (after Export/Import)
- Create new file: commands/daemons.md

## Current Issue State

From `.beads/beads.jsonl` modifications:
- bd-153: status changed to "closed" with reason "Implemented bd daemons killall..."
- bd-152: status changed to "closed" with reason "Implemented bd daemons logs..."
- bd-150: status changed to "closed" with reason "Updated AGENTS.md, README.md..."

These issues are marked closed in the database but the code doesn't exist.

## Recommended Recovery Steps

1. **Reopen the issues**:
   ```bash
   bd reopen bd-153 bd-152 bd-150 --reason "Code lost in git reset, needs reimplementation"
   ```

2. **Re-implement bd-153** (highest priority):
   - Modify cmd/bd/daemons.go
   - Modify internal/daemon/discovery.go
   - Modify internal/daemon/kill_unix.go
   - Modify internal/daemon/kill_windows.go
   - Test: `go build -o bd ./cmd/bd && ./bd daemons killall --help`

3. **Re-implement bd-152**:
   - Modify cmd/bd/daemons.go
   - Test: `./bd daemons logs --help` and `./bd daemons logs <workspace> -n 10`

4. **Re-implement bd-150**:
   - Modify AGENTS.md
   - Modify README.md
   - Create commands/daemons.md

5. **Commit carefully**:
   ```bash
   git add cmd/bd/daemons.go internal/daemon/discovery.go internal/daemon/kill_*.go
   git commit -m "Implement bd daemons killall and logs (bd-153, bd-152)"
   
   git add AGENTS.md README.md commands/daemons.md
   git commit -m "Document bd daemons commands (bd-150)"
   
   git add .beads/beads.jsonl
   git commit -m "Update issue metadata"
   
   git push
   ```

6. **Close issues again**:
   ```bash
   bd close bd-153 bd-152 bd-150 --reason "Implemented (recovered from git reset)"
   bd sync
   ```

## Lessons Learned

- Never use `git reset --hard` when there are uncommitted changes
- When facing rebase conflicts in JSONL, use `bd import --resolve-collisions` instead of git resolution
- Commit code changes immediately, sync issues separately
- Use `git stash` before any destructive git operations

## Files to Monitor

- `.beads/beads.jsonl` - Only file with current modifications
- No code changes exist in working directory
- No stashes contain the lost work
