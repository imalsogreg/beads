{"id":"bd-123","title":"Daemon storage cache doesn't detect external database modifications","description":"When bd commands bypass the daemon and directly modify the database (e.g., `bd import` with direct file access, or deleting/recreating bd.db), the daemon's cached storage connection becomes stale and serves outdated data.\n\n**Reproduction**:\n1. Start daemon: `bd daemon`\n2. Run bd stats → shows N issues\n3. Delete database: `rm .beads/bd.db`  \n4. Reinit and import: `bd init \u0026\u0026 bd import -i .beads/issues.jsonl`\n5. Run bd stats → shows 0 issues (wrong!)\n6. Direct query: `sqlite3 .beads/bd.db 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM issues'` → shows correct count\n7. Restart daemon: `bd daemon --stop` then retry stats → now shows correct count\n\n**Root cause**: \n- server.go:1410-1414 retrieves cached storage without checking if DB file changed\n- Cache only evicts based on TTL (30min) or LRU, never on external modifications\n- Direct file operations bypass daemon, leaving cache stale\n\n**Impact**:\n- Users see incorrect/stale data after external DB operations\n- Confusing behavior with no clear indication cache is stale\n- Requires daemon restart to fix\n\n**Proposed fixes**:\n1.

VC imports Beads (VC → Beads dependency) and wraps it with VC-specific storage methods. Both share the same database but maintain separate table namespaces.\n\n**Current Pain Points:**\n1. Code Duplication: Issue CRUD, dependency graphs, labels, status transitions all reimplemented\n2. Schema Drift Risk: VC schema manually defined, could diverge from Beads\n3.

Maintenance Burden: Every Beads feature must be manually replicated\n\n**Concrete Example:**\nWhen Beads adds a new field (e.g., estimated_hours):\n- Current: 4-6 hours of manual work (update types, 6+ SQL queries, migration, testing)\n- With Library: 5 minutes (go get -u github.com/steveyegge/beads)\n\n**Phased Approach:**\n1.

The client should automatically detect version mismatches and handle them gracefully.\n\n**Current behavior:**\n- `bd version --daemon` shows mismatch but requires manual intervention\n- Old daemons keep running after binary upgrades\n- MCP server may connect to old daemon\n- Results in dirty working tree after commits, stale data\n\n**Proposed solution:**\n\nKey lifecycle points to check/restart daemon:\n1. **On first command after version mismatch**: Check daemon version, auto-restart if incompatible\n2. **On daemon start**: Check for existing daemons, kill old ones before starting\n3. **After brew upgrade/install**: Add post-install hook to kill old daemons\n4. **On `bd init`**: Ensure fresh daemon\n\n**Detection logic:**\n```go\n// PersistentPreRun: check daemon version\nif daemonVersion != clientVersion {\n    log.Warn(\"Daemon version mismatch, restarting...\")\n    killDaemon()\n    startDaemon()\n}\n```\n\n**Considerations:**\n- Should we be aggressive (always kill mismatched) or conservative (warn first)?\n- What about multiple workspaces with different bd versions?\n- Should this be opt-in via config flag?\n- How to handle graceful shutdown vs force kill?\n\n**Related issues:**\n- Race condition with auto-flush (see bd-50)\n- Version mismatch confusion for users\n- Stale daemon after upgrades","notes":"## Implementation Summary\n\nImplemented automatic daemon version detection and restart in v0.16.0.\n\n### Changes Made\n\n**1. Auto-restart on version mismatch (main.go PersistentPreRun)**\n- Check daemon version during health check\n- If incompatible, automatically stop old daemon and start new one\n- Falls back to direct mode if restart fails\n- Transparent to users - no manual intervention needed\n\n**2. Auto-stop old daemon on startup (daemon.go)**\n- When starting daemon, check if existing daemon has compatible version\n- If versions are incompatible, auto-stop old daemon before starting new one\n- Prevents \"daemon already running\" errors after upgrades\n\n**3. Robust restart implementation**\n- Sets correct working directory so daemon finds right database\n- Cleans up stale socket files after force kill\n- Properly reaps child process to avoid zombies\n- Uses waitForSocketReadiness helper for reliable startup detection\n- 5-second readiness timeout\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **Automatic**: No user action required after upgrading bd\n- **Transparent**: Works with both MCP server and CLI\n- **Safe**: Falls back to direct mode if restart fails\n- **Tested**: All existing tests pass\n\n### Related\n- Addresses race conditions mentioned in bd-51\n- Uses semver compatibility checking from internal/rpc/server.go","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-10-23T23:15:59.764705-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-24T13:51:54.439179-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-23T23:28:06.611221-07:00"}
{"id":"bd-51","title":"Race condition between git commit and auto-flush debounce","description":"When using MCP/daemon mode, operations trigger a 5-second debounced auto-flush to JSONL. This creates a race condition with git commits, leaving the working tree dirty.\n\n**Example scenario:**\n1. User closes issue via MCP → daemon schedules flush (5 sec delay)\n2. User commits code changes → JSONL appears clean\n3. Daemon flush fires → JSONL modified after commit\n4. Result: dirty working tree showing JSONL changes\n\n**Root cause:**\n- Auto-flush uses 5-second debounce to batch changes\n- Git commits happen immediately\n- No coordination between flush schedule and git operations\n\n**Possible solutions:**\n\n1. **Immediate flush before git operations**\n   - Detect git commands (commit, status, push)\n   - Force immediate flush if pending\n   - Pros: Clean working tree guaranteed\n   - Cons: Requires hooking git, may be slow\n\n2. **Commit includes pending flushes**\n   - Add `bd sync` to commit workflow\n   - Wait for flush to complete before committing\n   - Pros: Simple, explicit\n   - Cons: Requires user discipline\n\n3. **Git hooks integration**\n   - pre-commit hook: `bd sync --wait`\n   - Ensures JSONL is up-to-date before commit\n   - Pros: Automatic, reliable\n   - Cons: Requires hook installation\n\n4. **Reduce debounce delay**\n   - Lower from 5s to 1s or 500ms\n   - Pros: Faster sync, less likely to race\n   - Cons: More frequent I/O, doesn't eliminate race\n\n5. **Lock-based coordination**\n   - Daemon holds lock while flush pending\n   - Git operations wait for lock\n   - Pros: Guarantees ordering\n   - Cons: Complex, may block operations\n\n**Recommended approach:**\nCombine #2 and #3:\n- Add `bd sync` command to explicitly flush\n- Provide git hooks in `examples/git-hooks/`\n- Document workflow in AGENTS.md\n- Keep 5s debounce for normal operations\n\n**Related:**\n- bd-50 (daemon version detection)","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-23T23:16:29.502191-07:00","updated_at":"2025-10-24T22:17:18.871457-07:00","closed_at":"2025-10-24T22:17:18.871457-07:00"}

Disable auto-flush by default (require explicit --enable-auto-flush)\n2. Add .beadsignore to exclude issue ID patterns\n3. Make auto-flush only export 'real' issues (exclude test-*)\n4.

Document that production DB is for real work only\n2. Add a convenience command: `bd test-create` that uses a separate test database\n3. Clean up the existing test pollution: bd-127 through bd-19\n4. Consider adding a git pre-commit hook to warn about suspicious issues\n\nThis preserves auto-flush (which is valuable) while preventing pollution at the source.","notes":"## Resolution\n\n**Root Cause Identified:**\nThe issue was NOT a bug in auto-flush, but rather test pollution in the production database from manual testing/debugging. Go tests are properly isolated using temp directories.\n\n**Actions Taken:**\n1. Cleaned up test pollution: deleted bd-127 through bd-19 (all \"Version test issue\" entries)\n2. Verified auto-flush is working correctly - it exports the database as designed\n3. Confirmed Go test isolation works properly (uses temp dirs, not production DB)\n\n**Prevention Strategy:**\n- Production database (.beads/) should only contain real work issues\n- Manual testing should use throwaway databases or test scripts\n- Go tests already use isolated temp databases\n- Auto-flush is working as intended and should remain enabled\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis was user error, not a system bug.

Migrate dependencies from source → target\n2. Update text references across all issues\n3.
